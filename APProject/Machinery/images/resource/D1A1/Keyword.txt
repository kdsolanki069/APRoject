3)  1A1 Cylindrical Diamond Wheel

1A1 Diamond grinding wheel is used for machining of conical,cylindrical and flat surface,cylindrical and conical aperatures. Our 1A1 diamond grinding wheels include ceramic diamond bruting wheel for natural diamond polishing, resin diamond grinding wheel for HVOF tungsten carbide coating, cylindrical diamond grinding wheel for PCD tools, CBN grinding wheel for crankshaft and camshaft grinding,vitrified diamond grinding wheel for rough and precision PDC cutter, etc


Cylindrical grinding applications – 1A1 wheels:
• Includes all outside grinding of round
parts, even though the finished product is
not always a true cylinder.
• Infeed at both ends of the traverse to keep
wheel face flat.
• Use work supports to prevent deflection.
• Rough grinding traverse speed should be
1/2 to 2/3 of the thickness of the wheel per work revolution.
• Finishing grinding traverse speed should be 1/2" or less per
work revolution.
It is the user’s responsibility to refer to and comply
with ANSI B7.1
